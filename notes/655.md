## V1.0
### Fill the vector
Take "Example 2" in the question descrition as an example, we can compress the answer into one vector: `[x,2,4,1,x,3,x]`, where `x` represnets empty node. If you think it *recursively*, it's easily to find out that **the root locates in the middle of leaves in an vector**. 

In the first level in the tree, `1` is the root and thus in the middle of the entire vector. And `1` has two children: `2` and `3`. They are in the middle of left and right part of the vector except for `1`, respectively: `2` in `[x,2,4]` and `3` in `[x,3,x]`.

Let's back to our question: the capacity of outer vector is the height of binary tree, and the capacify of inner vector is the maximum total number of nodes in the tree. Given an intialized vector of vectors of string (suppose we know the height and capacity), we can fill the vector *recursively*.

```cpp
int middleIndex(int lo, int hi) {
    return lo + (hi-lo)/2;
}

// fill an intialized vector based on root TreeNode
void fillVector(TreeNode* root, vector <vector <string>> &v,
                int level, int lo, int hi) {
    if (!root) return;
    int mid = middleIndex(lo, hi);
    v[level][mid] = to_string(root->val);
    if (root->left || root->right) {  // not leaf
        fillVector(root->left, v, level+1, lo, mid-1);
        fillVector(root->right, v, level+1, mid+1, hi);
    }
}
```

### Find the height
Now that we find out how to "fill the vector", we need to know the size of the vector. Since we're dealing with a typical binary tree, it's easy to conclude that given a tree with height *h*, the maximize of total of nodes is *2^h-1*, which is also the capacity of each inner vector in the question.

```cpp
int getTreeHeight(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) {return 0;}
    if (!root->left && !root->right) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        int left = getTreeHeight(root->left);
        int right = getTreeHeight(root->right);
        return (left>=right) ? left+1 : right+1;
    }
}

vector< vector<string> > printTree(TreeNode* root) {
    int height = getTreeHeight(root);
    int length = pow(2, height) - 1;
    vector<vector <string>> ret;
    for (int i = 0; i < height; ++i) {
        vector<string> tmp (length, "x");
        ret.push_back(tmp);
    }
    fillVector(root, ret, 0, 0, length-1);
    return ret;
}
```

### Complexity
**Time Complexity**: *O(h)*  
- `fillVector()`: *O(h)*  
- `getTreeHeight()`: *O(h)*  
- `printTree()`: *O(h)*  

**Space Complexity**: *O(2^h)*
